Developing a Flight Delay Prediction Model using Machine Learning

The airline industry has been the backbone of transportation ever since the 1950s. It is important to ensure that the 
aviation industry has safety and punctuality at its peak, as many VIPS, business personalities, and sports teams use 
aircraft as their primary transport for important events. Although the industryâ€™s safety and customer service record 
is close to the best it has ever been, there are still rare occasions where passengers are inconvenienced by delays 
or even cancellations which end up costing the industry and the economy a lot. 

According to the estimation by the Total Delay Impact Study, the total cost of air transportation delays to air travelers 
and the airline industry in 2007 was $32.9 billion in the US, resulting in a $4 billion reduction in GDP. Therefore, 
predicting flight delays can improve airline operations and passenger satisfaction, which will positively impact the 
economy. Thus, building the right system using a suitable model is of great importance.
